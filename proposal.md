#Proposal
A project proposal for the Advanced Manufacturing Research Institute.

##Objective
Experiment with convergence of ink jet print head technology and RepRap software and hardware.


##Project Outline
The goal of this project is to improve upon ink jet printing with RepRap technologies for use in the research and the DIY levels. We will achieve this by using existing open source software and hardware as the basis. The scientific method will be used throughout the process, along with an open lab notebook published to GitHub. This will ensure in the event all goals are not attained, useful data will be available to the Internet community, in the form of Git repositories.
###Hardware integration
The first stage of the project will be the integration of ink jet print heads with RepRap mechanics. This will require design of adapters to mount the ink jet heads in place of (or besides) a RepRap extrusion nozzle.
###Software integration
In order to achieve integration with RepRap software, I will focus on contributing to existing projects as much as possible. On the control side of the RepRap, we can leverage Marlin as a development base. On the host side, it will be necessary to build software to handle generation of nozzle firing sequences.
###Electronics Integration
UltiMachine has funded the purchase of 6 InkShields and 11 ink jet heads for this project. I will use RAMBo as a controller base, but design all software to be applicable to any controller with enough extra output pins.
