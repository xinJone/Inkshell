#Retrosynthetic Analysis
Jordan Miller introduced me to this technique. The wikipedia [page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrosynthetic_analysis) describes it as "a technique for solving problems in the planning of organic syntheses. This is achieved by transforming a target molecule into simpler precursor structures without assumptions regarding starting materials."

In this diagram orange boxes represent our basis for experimentation. Blue boxes represent our decisions. Light green diamonds represent decisions, and the neon green box is the objective.
