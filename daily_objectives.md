## Point analysis
The scanner will be here today, so I will be able to test my droplet analysis scripts.
The focus will be on using the printer to generate some output we can scan and quantify. If proven useful I will document the scripts, and begin designing potential experiments around variations in motion and timing.
### Ideas for experiments
* How accurate is the placement of the droplets?
* How does speed influence shape?
* How does pausing influence shape?
* How does pulse timing affect size?

I will use hexagonal droplet patterns to test this as they will have a good balance between spread and density.

## Point analysis
### Goal
Simulation based experiment to quantitatively measure droplet position and shape accuracy.
### Quantify
* Circularity
* Ellipsoid function (momentum)
* Thresholding
* Positioning (gantry positioning and nozzle inaccuracies)
### Experiment
We will generate sample output using an image editor. The samples will be of ideal and poor output. OpenCV or ImageJ will be used to quantify these images computationally.

## Supplies
* Slides and cover slips
* Filter paper
* Vacuum table

## AMRI maintenance
* Email Matt about laser cutter training
* AMRI Google group mailing list
